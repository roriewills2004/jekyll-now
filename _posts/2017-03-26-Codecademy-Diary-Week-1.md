This is my codecademy diary for the week starting 20th March.

Monday 20th:

This was my first exercise at home after the lesson on Monday. It was the exercise about the holiday trip, where you had to use costs and add them up. I found that I could do this exercise quite comfortably. It took me 5 minutes to complete this exercise.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/nQ7sIkJFjaCY9aq75UPQ_img_1.png)

This was the next exercise. This was about adding the cost of a rental car to the cost of the hotel. This exercise took me longer because I forgot to add the 'and days < 7'. This was an important part because it meant that you couldnâ€™t combine the deals. This exercise took me 10 minutes. 

Wednesday 22nd:

This exercise was on the total cost of the whole trip. I had to add up all the prices to find the total of the whole trip. I found this exercise ok. It took me 8 mins.![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/nQ7sIkJFjaCY9aq75UPQ_img_3.png)

For this exercise all I had to do was add a third argument spending_money. This would add any extra spending money. It took me 2 mins.

This last one was actually finding the cost of a trip. I added in at the end for it to print the total cost for a trip in Los Angeles with 600 dollars spending money. I took me 3 mins.

Friday 24th:

This exercise was starting on lists. This exercise was on creating a list on animals. A key thing is that a list starts at 0. 3 mins.

This exercise writing an assignment statement that replaces tiger with another value. I changed it to the string monkey.3 mins. 

Sunday 26th:

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/nQ7sIkJFjaCY9aq75UPQ_img_8.png)This exercise was about appending items to a list. I found it relatively simple. 3 mins.

This exercise was about list slicing. It's when you only want to access a portion of a list. 3 mins.

This was still about list slicing. 5 mins because at the end of the last line I didn't realise inside the bracket you would put no number. No number means end of the list. I kept trying loads of different numbers.

This exercise was about when you need to search for an item in a list.

4 mins.
