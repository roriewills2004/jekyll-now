Starting Point: To make a shopping device using coding that adds it up for you.

Target for this lesson: To make a shopping device.

Did I reach my target? Yes I did, I made the shopping device.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

I watched what the teacher was doing, listened to what he said, remembered it and when I went away I applied the techniques to make mine. I also kept trying new things. If I couldn't find one of the functions I would search for it more and not ask the teacher.

What did you make? 

What I made was a list of shopping items e.g socks, hats etc. I would then have the headings Item,Quantity,Item price,Total. I would write an Item in the 

Item section e.g jumper. The quantity is how many someone picks. The Item price is how much it costs, e.g £30. The total is the quantity multiplied by the Item price. But I do not do the work. I used VLOOKUP Oso that the computer would look up 'jumper' in the item list and see how much it was. It would automatically put the price in the item price section. Another bit of code did the second calculation for me ‘quantity multiplied by item price’. This would give the total price.
