Starting Point: To understand encryption.

Target for this lesson: Understanding the basics.

Did I reach my target? Yes I did, I now understand the basics.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

Because I missed the second lesson where we actually started encryption work I didn't understand the task so what I did was I asked one of my friends to tell me how to do it and then I did from then on by myself. One strategy that was effective was asking others.

What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?

One thing that I need to work on that is a habit is giving up. If I could not do it I would get frustrated and give up, meaning no progress was made. This was a big setback and made me do lot less work.

What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

I will try to work faster because sometimes I spent too long on one bit of work which meant I didn't get enough of what should be done in the lesson so I have to do more homework. To improve my learning I will work better so I get more done in the time provided.  Also to improve my learning I will look back at my work from the lesson so I can review my work and try and improve it on the next lesson.
