Starting Point: Getting the computer to add, subtract, multiply and divide for you.

Target for this lesson: Getting it to work.

Did I reach my target? Yes I did, the computer could do sums for me.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

I watched what the teacher was doing, what code he wrote and the function he used e.g def, print, and if he used strings or not. I listened to what he said, remembered past techniques and when I went away I applied the techniques to make my code function. I also kept trying new orders, adding indents and especially colons at the end of the def line.

What did you make? 

What I made was a code that would add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers, and I made sure it did not add it as a string, I made sure the computer knew the numbers were integers not strings. If it thought they were strings, 5+6=56 not 11. If you add int before the numbers in brackets then it would know they were integers and add them correctly. I also had to make sure that I would return the answer not print it. When you put in a sum, the computer gets an answer, and must return it, so it knows it completed it and can give something back.
