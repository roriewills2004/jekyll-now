Starting Point: To make a plan of the coding for a buzzfeed quiz.

Target for this lesson: Starting the plan.

Did I reach my target? Yes, I started my plan.

Lesson Review

How did I learn? What strategies were effective?  

I learnt by first of all going onto Buzzfeed and actually doing some quizzes. This was so I could get to grips on what the general base of the quizzes were. For example a common statement e.g 'We can guess your age' , and the types of question it would ask e.g ‘What bands would you listen to from these 6’. I then went and applied similar techniques to my plan. I had a main statement and some questions to start it off.

What did you make? 

What I made was a plan for my buzzfeed quiz. It was simple, a main statement, six questions all with eight options to choose from. The main statement was 'I can guess your age.' There were six questions one being ‘Which of these artists/bands are you most likely to listen to’ and then eight options one being ‘Drake’. Then there were eight corresponding answers. So if they chose Drake it would have a corresponding age e.g 15-20. Then I repeated this for the other five questions.
