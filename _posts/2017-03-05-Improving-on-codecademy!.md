Lesson Review: 

Today was a great lesson! We came in and we went straight on to codecademy. I started on 18%, and by the end of the lesson I had gone up 7% to 25%. I was happy because the last lesson I was stuck on a exercise called "The big if." It was the end of a section and it was really bothering me! But I tackled it and got through it, and I felt I had improved just because I had completed that exercise. After that I found it easier on the start of the next section, passing through the firsts ones quite easily. Then it got harder and I only did one exercise after that. 

How did I learn?

I learnt by trying, and trying, and trying. It was simple, if I couldn't do it, I would see where it told me my error was, then I would go to that line, and change it. If it didn't work I would try something else, until I got it right.

Target:

Use more common sense, it sounds simple but I made a few silly mistakes. Also, if I am stuck, I should ask because I wasted some time where I could of asked for help. It would speed up the process and I could get a lot more done.
