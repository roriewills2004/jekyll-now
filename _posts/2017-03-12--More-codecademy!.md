Lesson review:

Today was a productive lesson. We walked in and went straight on to codecademy. Because Mr Keen had to leave Â¼ of the way through the lesson we just did a solid one hour of codecademy. I started the lesson on 25% and finished it on 25%. This is because I was on a very hard exercise, so it took me a long time to complete it. But, I finished it and started the next one. The exercise I was doing was the last pyg latin. I have been finding pyg latin very hard so when I completed it I was very happy. The reason it was a productive lesson was because I finished the hard exercise.

How did I learn?

I learnt by reading the instructions, following them, and if it didn't work then I would try something else. If it had been really long since I had made any progress then I would ask a friend for help. But they wouldn't give me the answer, they would just point me in the right direction.

Target:

I know the that there is something I can always improve on, but this lesson I think I did pretty well. The only thing I could work on is going a bit faster, but on the work I think I did quite well.
