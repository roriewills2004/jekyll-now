In the first four weeks of IT we did excel, creating a code and using VLOOKUP. We used this to make an encrypted code that needed decoding. By using VLOOKUP and other actions such as concatenate we could decode our code with a simple system without doing any hard work. By creating a table and encrypting our code we could then decode it.

This is my work from the first two lessons. You can see at the top I have my letters that make up the code. For example E=g. I then use HLOOKUP and then the position of the letters to get it to encrypt it. You have to put $ in between the letters otherwise it doesn't separate them, and then the computer can’t understand the code. So what the HLOOKUP does is it takes the letter from the decoded code and then solves it.

You can also add LEFT which displays the next letter from the ones in the box to the left. There is also switch, which tells you if there is a letter on that character. For example, the 6th character in 'Hello World' is W. So on the switch line on the 6th character it would show ‘I’ to show there is a character on that position.
