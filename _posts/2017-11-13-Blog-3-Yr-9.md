**Blog 3 Yr 9****                     ****Date 13/11/17**

   In today's lesson we carried on our work from last week. We added a discount to our prices and added code so the computer would do it for us and we only had to put the code in in the first place. I decided that if someone was buying more than five items they would get 20% off. The code for this was '=IF(F19>5,G19*(100-H19)/100)'. F19 is the quantity, G19 is the sum total and H19 is the discount.

As you can see from the picture at the bottom I have the total quantity, which with coding the computer knows is greater than 5 which gets it a discount. The sum total (using code) is all the prices added up, and the discount is 10% so using the code above the computer works out the discount code. 

This was the main objective of the lesson so this is all i have new to update you on!
