Lesson review

Today was a great lesson! We came in and we went straight on to codecademy. I started on 25%, and by the end of the lesson I had gone up 3% to 28%. I was happy because the last lesson I was stuck on a exercise. It was very hard but I managed it. It was the end of a section and it was really bothering me. After I had done it I felt really good because it was very hard. The next exercises were easier because they were the first few of the section ". Then it got harder and I only did one exercise after that. 

How did I learn?

I learnt by trying. It was simple, if I couldn't do it, I would see where it told me my error was, then I would go to that line, and change it. If it didn't work I would try something else, until I got it right. If I was stuck for a long time I would ask a partner to help me.

Target:

Use more common sense, it sounds simple but I made a few silly mistakes. Also, if I am stuck, I should ask because I wasted some time where I could of asked for help. It would speed up the process and I could get a lot more done.
